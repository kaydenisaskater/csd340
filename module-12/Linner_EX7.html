                        <p>I have been skateboarding for 10 years now. I gained the interest in the sport from my uncles.
                            My very first competition was in Grand Island, NE. I then started to attend competitions in Lincoln, NE at The Bay. 
                            In 2019, I competed in three Red Bull competitions throughout the midwest. I haven't been able to attend any competitions since Covid.

                        <p>I grew up with family members who worked on various types of engines. My dad worked on motorcycle engines that are place in mini sprint cars. 
                            He also worked on the family's vehicles. My uncle works at Bruce's Transmission, and also works on motorcycles. A few years back, I used to race
                            the mini sprint cars in Hastings, NE. I now own a 1991 Mazda RX7 that has been engine swapped with a 302 V8 from an old Ford Mustang.

                        <p>Starting in middle school, I learned how to play the violin. I continued to play the violin until my senior year of high school. I stopped 
                            the violin after high school, and I started teaching myself how to play the guitar. At the start of the pandemic, I purchased a bass guitar, 
                            and I started teaching myself that. I now own two electric guitars, an acoustic guitar, and a bass guitar.

                        <p>I started working at the Buckle's service desk in 2019 as a part-time employee. I was let go during the pandemic since I was a part timer. Once 
                            a position was available, I applied to the position again. I have been employed as a full-time employee since December of 2020. The Buckle offers 
                            a Software Development internship, which I am going to try and take part in once I have completed schooling.

                        <p>My love for computers started when I built my first computer in my freshman year of high school. I built the computer to be a gaming computer. 
                            I gained an interest in technology after building it, and I took the few programming classes that were offered at Kearney High School. I took 
                            a beginner HTML and CSS course, as well as a class where we programmed using code blocks in a webpage. It was called Scratch, and we would program
                            apps for an Android tablet. I began attending Central Community College after high school where I started taking more programming languages. At CCC, 
                            I learned C#, PHP, Java, and SQL. I developed a better understanding of HTML and CSS and learned about Bootstrap. I learned Python and more Java in 
                            my first few semesters at Bellevue University.

                            means professional, or finished. I had made it in one week with many late nights and a few all-nighters to finish the website for Hope when it was needed.
